// DONE: 1. contains some constants, as well as the prototypes of the KLT package API functions.
// DONE: 2. Understand what each of the fields in proc struct means to the process.
// DONE: 3. transfer the entire system to work with the new thread structure.
// DONE: 4. every process will have 1 initial thread running in it.
// todo: 5. create the system calls that will allow the user to create and manage new threads.



/*
 * DONE: moving to threads #task1.1
 * DONE: 1. Add a pointer to current thread (of type struct thread) right after the pointer to proc struct
 * (see struct cpu at proc.h).
 * DONE: 2. Update function seginit (see vm.c) so that the line 31:
 * c->gdt[SEG_KCPU] = SEG(STA_W, &c->cpu, 8, 0);
 * will be replaced with following line:
 * c->gdt[SEG_KCPU] = SEG(STA_W, &c->cpu, 12, 0);
 * DONE: 3. Add a global pointer to current thread by inserting following line to proc.h:
 * extern struct thread *thread asm("%gs:8");
 */
// DONE: additional changes may be required (e.g., the scheduler, for example, must update thread in addition to proc).
// DONE: Add a constant to kthread.h called NTHREAD = 16.
// DONE: each process should contain its own static array of threads.

/*
 * todo: synchronizing all shared fields of the thread owner when they are accessed
 * DONE: add lock to proc struct,
 */

 * DONE: EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

/*
 * This function terminates the execution of the calling thread. If called by a thread (even the main thread)
 * while other threads exist within the same process, it shouldnâ€™t terminate the whole process. If it is the
 * last running thread, process should terminate. Each thread must explicitly call kthread_exit() in order to
 * terminate normally.

 * This function suspends the execution of the calling thread until the target thread (of the same process),
 * indicated by the argument thread_id, terminates. If the thread has already exited (or not exists),
 * execution should not be suspended. If successful, the function returns zero. Otherwise, -1 should be
 * returned to indicate an error.

// DONE: 1. contains some constants, as well as the prototypes of the KLT package API functions.
// DONE: 2. Understand what each of the fields in proc struct means to the process.
// todo: 3. transfer the entire system to work with the new thread structure.
// todo: 4. every process will have 1 initial thread running in it.
// todo: 5. create the system calls that will allow the user to create and manage new threads.



/*
 * TODO: moving to threads #task1.1
 * DONE: 1. Add a pointer to current thread (of type struct thread) right after the pointer to proc struct
 * (see struct cpu at proc.h).
 * DONE: 2. Update function seginit (see vm.c) so that the line 31:
 * c->gdt[SEG_KCPU] = SEG(STA_W, &c->cpu, 8, 0);
 * will be replaced with following line:
 * c->gdt[SEG_KCPU] = SEG(STA_W, &c->cpu, 12, 0);
 * DONE: 3. Add a global pointer to current thread by inserting following line to proc.h:
 * extern struct thread *thread asm("%gs:8");
 */
// todo: additional changes may be required (e.g., the scheduler, for example, must update thread in addition to proc).
// DONE: Add a constant to kthread.h called NTHREAD = 16.
// DONE: each process should contain its own static array of threads.

/*
 * todo: synchronizing all shared fields of the thread owner when they are accessed
 * DONE: add lock to proc struct,

 * consistent with current memory allocator of xv6.

 * Calling kthread_create will create a new thread within the context of the calling process.
 * The newly created thread state will be RUNNABLE.
 * The caller of kthread_create must allocate a user stack for the new thread to use
 * (it should be enough to allocate a single page i.e., 4K for the thread stack).
 * This does not replace the kernel stack for the thread.
 * start_func is a pointer to the entry function, which the thread will start executing.
 * Upon success, the identifier of the newly created thread is returned.
 * In case of an error, a non-positive value is returned.
